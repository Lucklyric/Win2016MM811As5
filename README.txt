		-- task3.m //main script for task3
		-- workerScript.m //main script for task1
		-- ownEd.m//main fucntion for calculating the Euclidean distance

Too run the code
Using Matlab and open the matlab_scripts folder.
Run each script for each experiment task.

Notice:
Differnt parts of differnt task has differnt setting up.
There are some configurations might need to be modifed for different parts within one Task.

train_path: 	path for training dataset
test_path: 	path for test dataset
ed_mode: 	0 - full euclidean distance 
		1 - eraly abandoning
sequenceType: 	0 - original real numbers 
	      	1 - DFT full sequence 
	      	2 - DFT 5 coefficients 
	      	3 - DFT 10 coefficients 
              	4 - DFT 20 coefficients
symmetry_mode:  0 - not use symmetry property 
	        1 - use symmetry property
